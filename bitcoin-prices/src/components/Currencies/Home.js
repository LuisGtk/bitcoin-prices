            <p>Welcome to my Crypto app made in React. While I wanted to reacreate an older Project the API I used before is no longer working and I've yet to find one with the info needed. I hope you can enjoy the CSS put into making this creative layout. I will be grabbing the price of a Crypto Cureencies in USD for now.</p>
